# Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¬

This repository contains a **movie recommender system** developed as part of an internship project in collaboration with **IBM**. The system uses **collaborative filtering** and **long-tail recommendation** techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a recommender system that goes beyond popular choices by including long-tail (less popular) items. The notebook demonstrates how to build a recommendation engine that balances user preferences with a diverse range of movies.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user interactions, using patterns in user preferences.
- **Long-Tail Recommendations**: Includes lesser-known movies to diversify recommendations and expose users to new content.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gitcomplex/Movie-Recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
   ```
2. **Run the Notebook: Open Jupyter Notebook and launch the notebook file**:

  ```bash
    jupyter notebook recommender-sys.ipynb
  ```

## Notebook Contents

-> The notebook includes:

    1. Data Loading: Imports user-movie interaction data.
    2. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for collaborative filtering.
    3. Modeling: Implements collaborative filtering and integrates long-tail          recommendations.
    4. Evaluation: Evaluates the modelâ€™s accuracy and diversity of recommendations.

## Techniques Used
  - Collaborative Filtering: Identifies patterns in user behavior for personalized     suggestions.
  - Long-Tail Strategy: Balances popular and niche movies in recommendations.

## Future Work

- Adding content-based filtering to improve recommendation quality.
- Integrating hybrid recommendation approaches for a more robust system.
